# jest-demo

This project is created to host examples that will be use for demo to better understand jest testing.

There are 4 main examples:
### Basic setting up of jest test

In folder math/math, we will be going through how to create a test file and also create our test suite. Followed up with basic expect and matcher

### Mocking external function(jest.sypOn)

In the folder math/totalCost, we will be looking at how you can mock external function and also the return. External function can be found at the externalFunction folder

### Mock external module (jest.mock)

In the folder externalModule, we will be mocking axios and writing a test case for an api call

### Edge Cases

One of the aim of software testing is to make sure that edge cases are covered. In the folder edgeCases, we will be looking at an example where during testing we realised that there is a lapse in our function condition.
